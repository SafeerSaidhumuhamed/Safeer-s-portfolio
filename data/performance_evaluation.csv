Passage 1,"Big data primarily refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many entries (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate. Though used sometimes loosely partly due to a lack of formal definition, the best interpretation is that it is a large body of information that cannot be comprehended when used in small amounts only. Big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.","Big data is the term used to describe data sets that are too big or complex for conventional data-processing application software to handle. While data with more attributes or columns and higher complexity may result in a higher false discovery rate, data with many entries (rows) offer greater statistical power. The best interpretation is that it is a vast body of information that cannot be understood when used sparingly, even though it is occasionally used loosely due to a lack of formal definition. Data collection, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source are some of the challenges associated with big data analysis. Three fundamental ideas were initially connected to big data: volume, variety, and velocity.",QuillBot,Grammarly,12
